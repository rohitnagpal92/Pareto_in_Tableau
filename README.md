Pareto Principle - 80/20 Rule

Pareto chart is one of the most commonly used chart which is based on Pareto Principle, also known as 80/20 rule. In simple definition, Pareto Principle states that for many eventss, roughly 80% of the effects comes from 20% of the causes. 

For example, if we apply this concept in Retail business, it can be interpreted as 80% of the Revenue (effect) comes from 20% of the Customers (cause). Thus, Pareto chart can help the business to understand who are those 20% Customers generating 80% of Revenue and then necessary actions can be taken accodingly.
